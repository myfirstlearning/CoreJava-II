Input/Output
--java.io.package
-File class (java.io.File)
-file itself, directory
-new File("path of the file") (C:/users/appi/a.txt)
-Absolute vs Relative Path (a.txt,/appi/a.txt, ../a.txt)

--Streams(I/O streams)
-Byte Streams - byte and binary formats
-Character Streams - strings and characters, works well with textual data

--Builtin steams
-System.out
-System.in
-System.err

--Low level vs High level streams
-low level streams directly interact with the file system
-high level stream wraps the low level stream and can also take a high level stream as input
ex: BufferReader reader = new BufferReader(new FileReader("abc.txt"));
    ObjectInputStream os = new ObjectInputStream(new BufferedInputStream(new FileInputStream("abc.txt"));)
-we can not mix readers, writers, inputstreams, outputstreams and use them
ex: BufferedReader reader = new BuffereReader(new FileWriter());
    BufferedInputStream stream = new BufferedInputStream(new FileOutputStream());
-high level stream cannot directly interact with the filesystem directly
